# DOMAIN SEARCH APP

The Domain Search App is a convenient tool that allows you to search for information about domains.<br>
It utilizes a Domain Checker API from RapidAPI to retrieve comprehensive domain-related data.<br>
This app provides insights into domain availability, ownership, and other pertinent details.<br>
The user interface of this Email Validator App has been designed to resemble the UI of a similar project showcased in one of RapidAPI's blogs. 
I was inspired by their design and wanted to replicate a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for this app

## Features

- Search for information about any domain.
- Obtain details about domain availability and ownership.
